# TANGO token - ERC20 token sale 

The repo contains a **Solidity/Truffle** project that creates and deploys a ERC20 token sale, that will be called TANGO token (we have to support culture and shows that make us feel amazed 😉. 

The token sale contract has been deployed on Ropsten testnet, under the address 0xB065EcCDfEc883090426539cef61D63405635325. On this subject, you can also check and experiment on that testnet with the react front end available in [here](https://andresnaza.github.io/ERC20_token_sale/). As you can see, the DApp contains a simple whitelist, or KYC functionality, developed considering that those requirements can be mandatory for many different applications nowadays.

Although this project has been created as a work sample for my project portfolio, the work here can be use in real case scenarios, such as:
 
## Real-World Use-Case for this Project

💰 Tokenization of any Assets as fungible Tokens (ERC20)

🏦 Creation of Bonus Programs, Vouchers, etc.

💲 Creation of a new crypto currency

🧾 Creation of a Payment-layer on top of Ethereum
